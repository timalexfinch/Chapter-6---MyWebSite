                <p>Clear skies with a slight nip in the air, I could feel it was going to be a fine day even if it was only 5.30 a.m. There was no frost, so the roads wouldn't be icy. Forest of Dean, here we come! Thanks to having a highly organised mind (no, really!), preparations for the trip had been finalised two days previously and now all we had to do was load up the camper van, get the dog in the car, the kids settled and head off for a glorious, relaxing week away from the madding crowds.</p>

                <p>I had my checklist, just to be on the ultra safe side, and quickly checked that we had everything. Tent, backpacks, camping stove, first aid kit, dog pooper scooper and lead, a (small!) box of games for the kids, sleeping bags and basic food supplies. What could possibly go wrong?</p>

                <h2>Monday morning, stuck in roadworks</h2>

                <p>As the great Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu once said:</p>

                <blockquote>A good traveler has no fixed plans and is not intent on arriving.</blockquote>

                <p>Two hours into the journey and we hit roadworks, ironically at what should have been 15 minutes till our first carefully-planned leg-stretching pit stop at the Little Quality Inn. So there we were, with grumbling kids in the back complaining "are we there yet?", "how much longer, Dad?". There was a tailback for several miles and we were at a dead stop. A few of us got out to see if we could determine what was going on and how much longer we were going to wait.</p>

                <p>Eventually I spoke with a guy who had heard from the trucker ahead of him who'd seen something from his rig. A truck up ahead had gotten a blowout and, thanks to a loose rear door, a load of rotten fruit and veg he was carrying had spilt across the entire carriageway. A couple of following vehicles had skidded in it, no-one was hurt but it was a mess. I relayed the news to the wife and kids. They were NOT happy.</p>
